    <h2>I believe that honesty, compassion, respect, responsibilty, courage and accountable are necessary components to being a good citzenship</h2>
    <p>*Honesty is demenstrated when somebody tells the complete truth in any situation.</p>
    <p2>*Compassion is the ability to understand the emotional state of another person or oneself.</p>
    <p3>*Showing respect to someone means you act in a way that shows you care about their feelings and well-being.</p>
    <p4>*Being responsible means you do the things you are expected to do and accept the consequences of your actions.</p>
    <p5>*Courage is the ability to do something that frightens one.</p>
    <p6>*Being accountable means that you can be trusted to get the job done when asked and that you can be trusted.</p>
    <p7> A way in which that I performed an act of citzenship is that I volunteered at a local food bank.  I sorted the food and helped go through the expired goods.</p>
